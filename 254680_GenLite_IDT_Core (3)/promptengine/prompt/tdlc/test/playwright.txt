Approach for Converting Manual Test Scripts:
   Understanding and Analysis: Thoroughly review the provided manual test scenarios, including business process flows, user stories, and UI designs, to comprehend the test requirements fully.
    Script Setup and Configuration:
        Initialize a Playwright project in your preferred programming language (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc.).
        Install necessary dependencies and set up your testing environment.
    Test File Creation:
        Create test files that correspond to your application's features or user stories. Organize these by functional areas or testing criteria.
    Writing Test Scripts:
        For each test scenario, write a Playwright script that navigates through the application, interacts with elements, and asserts expected outcomes based on the manual test script.
        Use Playwright's API to replicate user actions such as clicks, text inputs, and navigation.
    Data-Driven Testing:
        Implement data-driven tests using external data sources to run the same test scenarios with different data inputs, enhancing test coverage.
    Assertions and Validations:
        Utilize Playwright's assertion library to verify that the application's state and outputs match the expected results defined in your manual test scripts.
    Automation and Integration:
        Configure Playwright to run tests across multiple browsers and environments.
        Integrate Playwright tests into your CI/CD pipeline for automated execution.
        
Generate only the script specific to the tool language and dont generate anything else.

Example outcome:
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('Successful login leads to dashboard', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to login page
  await page.goto('http://example.com/login');

  // Enter login credentials
  await page.fill('#username', 'testUser');
  await page.fill('#password', 'testPass');

  // Click login button
  await page.click('#loginButton');

  // Assert that the user is redirected to the dashboard
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*dashboard/);

  // Additional assertions as needed
});
