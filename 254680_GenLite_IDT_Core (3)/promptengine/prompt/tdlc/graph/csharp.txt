Role: Software Developer with Cypher Query Expertise

{# Introduction to the task. #}
Your task is to convert the following c# code into Cypher query along with please add property as `uniqueId: "{{ uniqueId }}"` for each create statement of cypher query. The original c# code is provided between `[code-start]` and `[code-end]`.

{# Original Source Code Section #}
Source Code: Provided between [code-start] and [code-end].
[code-start]
{{ sourcecode }}
[code-end]

{# Example Input Section #}
Refer the example below
Example c# code: Provided between [codeexample-start] and [codeexample-end].
[codeexample-start]
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Define variables for length and width
        double length = 5.0;
        double width = 3.0;

        // Calculate area
        double area = length * width;

        // Print the result
        Console.WriteLine("The area of the rectangle is: " + area);
    }
}

{# Instructions for Conversion #}
Output Required:
- Cypher Query: Convert C# code to Cypher queries. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

Step-by-Step Approach:
1. Understand the Data Model: Before writing Cypher queries, ensure you understand the data model. Identify the nodes (entities) and relationships between them.

2. Identify Query Objectives: Determine the purpose of your Cypher query. Are you querying for specific nodes, relationships, or patterns within the graph?

3. Translate Data Model to Cypher: Start by identifying how your C# objects correspond to nodes and relationships in Cypher. Each class in your C# code may map to a node type in the graph.

4. Mapping Classes to Nodes: For each class in your C# code representing entities, create corresponding node types in Cypher. 

5. Writing Node Creation Queries: Write Cypher queries to create nodes based on your C# objects. Use the CREATE clause in Cypher to create nodes with specified properties.
    - Here's the basic syntax:
    - CREATE Nodes
            Class Node: Represent each c# class.
            Property Node: Represent each c# property.
            Method Node: Represent each c# method.
            Event Node: Represent each c# event.
    - CREATE (node:Label {property1: value1, property2: value2, ...})
    - node is the variable representing the node in the query.
    - Label is the label assigned to the node (optional).
    - property1, property2, etc., are properties of the node.
    - value1, value2, etc., are the corresponding values of the properties.
    - Ensure each create statement has atleast one property "name"
    - Ensure there are no duplicate create statements for the same node/property
	
6. Mapping Relationships: If your C# code includes relationships between objects (like associations between User and other entities), map these to relationships .
    **Define Relationship Types:**
    - `CONTAINS`: Between namespaces and classes, classes and methods/properties
    - `INHERITS_FROM`: Between classes
    - `CALLS`: Between methods
    - `HAS_PROPERTY`: Between classes and properties
	
7. Writing Relationship Creation Queries: Use Cypher's Create clauses to create relationships between nodes. Ensure you specify the relationship type and any properties associated with the relationship.
    - The basic syntax for creating relationships in Cypher is as follows:
      (node1)-[:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]->(node2)
    - node1 and node2 are the nodes you want to connect.
    - RELATIONSHIP_TYPE is the type of relationship between the nodes. 

Considerations:
    - Ensure the code is clean, maintainable, and follows Cypher Query best practices.
     - Ensure the code is not having any syntax error, follow coding standards of cypher
     - DO NOT Create Cypher queries for Console.Log(), Console.Clear(), Console.WriteLine() and Console.ReadLine() methods of c# code
     - Ensure the uniqueId property is added to each node created in the cypher query
    
Proceed with these instructions to accurately convert the provided C# code into cypher queries.

Output only the cypher query without any additional explanations, comments, or text.
