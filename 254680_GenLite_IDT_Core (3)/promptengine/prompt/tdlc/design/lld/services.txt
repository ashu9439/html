Context:
As part of Scrum Team you are supporting an Application for which the key input High Level Design will be provided by the user.
Additionally you may be provided with Application Context, Business Context and Process Flow details. Note that not all these inputs will be available you will need to intelligently utilize best possible information based on provided inputs to perform the task.
{% if businesscontext != "" %}
We have outlined our Business Process Management (BPM) context, detailing Levels 1 to 4 between [businesscontext-start] and [businesscontext-end].
    L1-L4 Model Overview:
        L1: Industry Domain.
        L2: Industry Sub Domain.
        L3: Capability of Sub Domain
        L4: Sub Capabilities

[highlevel-design-end]
Your task is to generate a detailed design that translates the high-level design into actionable implementation strategies. 

Follow the steps below to complete this task:

    1. Review and Understand: Start with a thorough review of the application context, functional design, and high-level design. Ensure a complete understanding of the problem domain and the existing system, along with the technology stack it utilizes.
    2. Service Identification: Based on your understanding, identify the microservices that need to be designed. Each service should correspond to a specific business capability, ideally, an aggregate in your DDD.
    3. Service Design: For each identified service, provide details about its functionality, API interfaces, dependencies, architectural patterns, data management strategies, and integration details.
    4. Database Design: Detail the database design for each microservice. Remember, each service should have its own private database to maintain loose coupling.
    5. Security Measures: Define the security measures for each microservice, including access controls, data encryption, and compliance requirements.
    6. Service Communication: Define how the services will communicate with each other, considering the architectural styles and patterns defined in the high-level design.
    7. Observability Mechanisms: Decide on the mechanisms for logging, monitoring, and alerting for each service.
    8. Resilience Strategies: Define the strategies each service will use to handle failures, including error handling, retry mechanisms, and redundancy plans.
    9. Scalability Plans: Design scalability strategies for each service. Include designs for both horizontal and vertical scaling based on the predicted load for each service.
    10. Review and Refine: Review the detailed design, cross-checking with the functional design, high-level design, and any other reference documents to ensure all requirements are met. Refine as needed.

Output as,
Service 1: [Service Title]
    Description: [Description of the service functionality]
    Interfaces: [Detailed specification of the service's APIs]
    Dependencies: [List of dependencies and description of how they interact with the service]
    Architectural Patterns: [Description of architectural patterns used]
    Integration Details: [Detailed description of how the service interacts with other services]
    Data Management: [Details about the data management strategy]
    API Endpoints: [List and description of API endpoints]
    Service Integration: [Details about the service integration points]
    Security Measures: [Description of the security measures]
    Observability Mechanisms: [Details about logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms]
    Resilience Strategies: [Description of resilience and fault tolerance strategies]
    Scalability Plans: [Details about the scalability plans]

And so on for all identified services. Ensure to be detailed and specific in your responses.
