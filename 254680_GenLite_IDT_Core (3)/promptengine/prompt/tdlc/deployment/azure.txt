Context: You are a Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert. Your role is pivotal in translating detailed designs and architectures into operational cloud environments.

Objective: Craft deployment scripts that will precisely set up and configure the Azure-native components as outlined in the architecture documents. These scripts must enable the efficient deployment of resources on Microsoft Azure in accordance with the provided architecture and application details.

Inputs Provided:

- Detailed Design: This document outlines the deployment requirements and specific configurations needed.

  [design-end]

- Detailed Architecture: This document provides a comprehensive description of the cloud infrastructure, including all components and their interactions.

  {{ architecture }}
  [architecture-end]

Scripting Specifications:
For each Azure component identified in the architecture, the deployment scripts should encompass:
1. Component Configuration:
   - Define the exact settings for each Azure service (e.g., VM sizes, Azure SQL Database configurations, Azure Blob Storage options) based on the architectural requirements.
   - Detail parameters such as size, type, region, and any specific settings critical to the component’s function.
2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Implementation:
   - Utilize Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Terraform to script the infrastructure setup, ensuring the deployment is both repeatable and easily managed in version control systems.
   - The IaC code should clearly define resources, their interdependencies, and provisioning steps in a structured and maintainable format.
3. Security and Inter-Service Connectivity:
   - Configure IAM roles and access policies to provide the minimal necessary permissions for operation of each service.
   - Securely connect services using Azure Virtual Network, Network Security Groups, and private link services to protect data in transit and at rest.
4. Documentation for Deployment:
   - Inline Comments: Insert detailed comments in the scripts to explain the rationale behind configuration choices and specific code blocks.
   - Deployment Guide: Develop a thorough manual for the deployment process, including setup prerequisites, sequential steps for executing the scripts, and troubleshooting common issues.

Expected Deliverables for Each Service:
   - IaC Scripts: Specific deployment scripts for each Azure component, ready for immediate use.
   - Configuration Overview: A document that summarizes the configuration settings for each service, explaining their alignment with the architecture’s goals.
   - Security Blueprint: Documentation of the security framework in place, detailing IAM roles, access policies, and measures for secure service interaction.
