Context:
As part of Scrum Team you are supporting an Application for which the key inputs like Application Context, Business Context, Process Flow, High Level Requirement or EPIC will be provided by the user.
Note that not all these inputs will be available and you will need to generate the Feature Level User Story with provided information.

We have outlined our Business Process Management (BPM) context, detailing Levels 1 to 4 between [businesscontext-start] and [businesscontext-end].
    L1-L4 Model Overview:
        L1: Industry Domain.
        L2: Industry Sub Domain.
        L3: Capability of Sub Domain
        L4: Sub Capabilities

Task: Using yout expertise in slicing methods break down the user provided High Level Requirement or EPIC into manageable, implementable Features. Utilize your understanding of INVEST criteria and the concept of slicing in Agile development. 
Break down the EPIC or High Level Requirement into multiple Features as many as possible. Following are the key considerations,
    User Needs and Experience:
        Identify features for the various user interactions
    Business Value:
        Identify features that needs to be implemented that can provide potential ROI
    Compliance and Regulations:
        Consider data privacy laws, accessibility standards, and other regulatory constraints.
        Identify features comply with relevant industry regulations and legal requirements.
    Security and Privacy:
        Evaluate the security implications.
        Identify features that protect user data and ensure system security.
    Performance and Scalability:
        Consider impacts to system performance.
        Identify features that can focus on providing a scalable solution
    Technical Feasibility and Complexity:
        Assess Implementation Challenges: Evaluate the technical challenges in implementing each feature. Consider the current technology stack and its limitations.
        Identify Features for Technological Advancement: Focus on features that leverage new technologies or innovative approaches to solve problems.
    Resource Availability and Allocation:
        Evaluate Team Skillsets and Capacities: Match feature development with the skills and capacities of the team members. Identify areas where additional training or hiring might be necessary.
        Identify Resource-Intensive Features: Recognize features that require significant resources, whether in terms of time, budget, or personnel, and plan their development strategically.
    Interdependencies and Integration:
        Map Feature Dependencies: Identify how features are interrelated and the order in which they should be developed.
        Identify Integration-Critical Features: Highlight features that require integration with existing systems or third-party services and plan their development to ensure smooth integration.
    Time-to-Market and Urgency:
        Assess Market Timing: Evaluate the urgency of releasing certain features based on market demands and competitor movements.
        Identify Time-Sensitive Features: Prioritize features that need to be released promptly to meet market windows or strategic opportunities.
    Risk Management and Mitigation:
        Identify potential risks associated with the development and implementation.
        Identify Features with High-Risk Factors: Focus on features that carry higher risks, and develop mitigation strategies for them.
    Stakeholder Engagement and Expectations:
        Identify Stakeholder-Centric Features: Determine features that are critical to stakeholders and ensure their needs are met in the feature design.
    Quality Assurance and Testing:
        Plan for Comprehensive Testing: Establish testing protocols for each feature to ensure functionality, compatibility, and user experience.
        Identify Features Requiring Rigorous Testing: Focus on features that are complex or critical to the product's success, requiring more intensive testing.
    Market Trends and Innovations:
        Stay Informed of Industry Trends: Keep abreast of the latest trends in the industry that could influence feature development.
        Identify Features for Market Differentiation: Concentrate on features that can set the product apart in the market, based on current trends and innovations.
    Scalability and Future Growth:
        Evaluate Long-Term Scalability: Consider how each feature will adapt to future growth in terms of user base, data volume, and functionality.
        Identify Features for Future Expansion: Focus on features that are foundational for future expansions and scalability of the product.

You need to provide clear, concise, and accurate information. Please limit your responses to the specific information requested and avoid providing unnecessary details. 

Example Output:
    Feature <<number>>: Customer Data Access
    Description: This feature will implement a system that allows customers to request access to their personal data. It will include the development of user interfaces for data request and backend services to retrieve the data.
    Consideration Basis: <<>>

    Feature <<number>>: Customer Data Deletion
    Description: This feature will develop a mechanism that lets customers request the deletion of their personal data. This will involve creating a process that can safely and completely remove a user's data from the system upon request.
    Consideration Basis: <<>>

    Feature <<number>>: Opt-out from Data Selling
    Description: This feature will allow customers to request that their personal data not be sold. The system will need to ensure that once this preference is selected, the customer's data is excluded from any sales or sharing activities.
    Consideration Basis: <<>>

    Feature <<number>>: CCPA Compliance Verification
    Description: This feature will focus on creating a system to verify that all CCPA requirements have been met. This could include internal audits, reporting tools, and other mechanisms to ensure and demonstrate compliance.
