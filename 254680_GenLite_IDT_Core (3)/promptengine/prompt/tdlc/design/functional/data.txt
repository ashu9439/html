Step by Step Approach for creating FSD:
When provided with application context, business context, and other similar inputs, here's how you should effectively use them in creating a Functional Specification Document (FSD):

    Application Context:
    - Purpose and Scope: Understand the overall purpose and scope of the application. This includes the primary functions of the application and its intended users.
    - Technical Environment: Familiarize yourself with the technical environment in which the application operates, including existing software, hardware, and network infrastructure.
    - Integration Points: Identify how the application integrates with other systems or external services.
    - Limitations and Constraints: Note any technological or business limitations that might affect the design.

    Business Context:
    - Business Objectives: Understand the key business objectives that the application aims to achieve. This helps in aligning the functional design with business goals.
    - Stakeholder Analysis: Identify key stakeholders and their interests, concerns, and influence on the project. This ensures the design meets their needs and expectations.
    - Market and Industry Trends: Be aware of any market or industry trends that might influence the application's functionality or priorities.

    Process Flow Details:
    - Existing Processes: Examine any existing business processes that the application will support or replace. This helps in ensuring that the new design seamlessly integrates with current operations.
    - Process Improvements: Identify opportunities for process improvements or optimizations that the new application can facilitate.
    - Workflow Mapping: Map out the detailed workflows that the application will automate or support, including decision points, user roles involved, and expected outcomes.

    Utilizing Information:
    - Gap Analysis: Conduct a gap analysis between current capabilities and desired functionalities, using the provided context to identify what needs to be developed or enhanced.
    - Requirement Prioritization: Prioritize requirements based on their alignment with business goals, user needs, technical feasibility, and resource availability.
    - Design Considerations: Use the gathered information to make informed decisions about the user interface, data structures, security measures, and process workflows.

    User Story Analysis: If a user story is provided, thoroughly understand its context, the target user, their goals, and motivations. 
    - Acceptance Criteria: Analyze these to capture business logic needs and design implications.
    - DoR and DoD: Ensure requirements are well-defined (DoR) and have clear completion criteria (DoD).
    - Tasks/Sub-tasks: Identify necessary steps for implementing the feature, guiding functional design.
    High-Level Requirement Analysis: If a high-level requirement is provided, convert it into detailed requirements before proceeding with the functional design.

Your Task: Create a detailed Functional Specification Document focusing on Data Design. Use the provided template format between <fds-output-template-start> and <fds-output-template-end>, addressing each section with relevant details. 

Ensure the following,
   - Detailed Requirements: Translate the business and application contexts into detailed functional requirements.
   - Design Specifications: Develop clear and concise design specifications that align with the detailed requirements, ensuring they are feasible within the given contexts.
   - Traceability: Maintain traceability between requirements, design elements, and business objectives to ensure that all components of the FSD are aligned and justified.

Note: Your output should be an actual functional design. Do not generate anything else.

Output template is as follows,
<fds-output-template-start>
Data Models - In this section, detail the data models and schema designs that define how the data will be structured and organized. Key points to include:
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD): If applicable, provide an ERD illustrating the relationships between different data entities. Label entities and attributes clearly.
- Database Tables: List the database tables that will be used to store data. Include the table names, primary keys, and any foreign keys.
- Data Attributes: For each table, specify the data attributes (columns) with their data types, constraints, and descriptions. Define which attributes are required and which are optional.
- Normalization: Explain the normalization process applied to the data schema, including the normal forms (e.g., 1NF, 2NF, 3NF) achieved to minimize data redundancy and maintain data integrity.
- Indexes: Describe any indexes created on the tables for optimizing data retrieval. Explain the purpose of each index and how it improves query performance.

Data Access Methods - In this section, outline how data will be accessed and manipulated within the application. Be sure to provide details on data access patterns, APIs, and query methods:
- API Specifications: If your application uses APIs for data access, document the API endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and any versioning strategies.
- SQL Queries: If SQL databases are involved, provide sample SQL queries for common data operations (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Include parameterization and best practices for query optimization.
- Data Caching: Discuss any data caching strategies employed to reduce database load and enhance application performance. Describe the cache mechanisms used and when data will be invalidated or refreshed.
- Concurrency Control: Explain how the data layer handles concurrent data access and updates to maintain data consistency. Mention any locking mechanisms or concurrency control strategies in use.

Data Security and Compliance - This section focuses on data security measures and compliance requirements to ensure data protection and regulatory adherence:
- Data Encryption: Describe how data is encrypted both in transit (e.g., using HTTPS) and at rest (e.g., database encryption). Specify encryption algorithms and key management practices.
- Access Controls: Detail access control mechanisms, including role-based access control (RBAC) or permissions, that restrict data access to authorized users and roles.
- Audit Logging: Explain how audit logs are implemented to track data access and modifications for compliance and security monitoring.
- Compliance Requirements: Identify any regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and describe how the data design addresses these compliance needs, such as data anonymization or consent management.

Performance Considerations - This section addresses strategies for optimizing data layer performance:
- Data Indexing: Explain which columns are indexed, the types of indexes (e.g., B-tree, bitmap), and how indexing improves query performance.
- Caching Strategies: Elaborate on caching techniques, such as in-memory caching or content delivery networks (CDNs), used to speed up data retrieval and reduce latency.
- Query Optimization: Discuss query optimization techniques, such as query rewriting, query plan analysis, and use of database hints to enhance query performance.
- Scalability: Describe how the data layer is designed to handle scalability requirements, including horizontal scaling (e.g., sharding) and vertical scaling (e.g., increasing hardware resources).
- Monitoring and Tuning: Outline how performance monitoring tools are used to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the data layer. Mention any proactive tuning practices to maintain optimal performance.
By providing comprehensive information in these sections, your data design document will serve as a valuable resource for developers and stakeholders, ensuring that the data layer is well-structured, secure, compliant, and optimized for efficient data processing and retrieval.
