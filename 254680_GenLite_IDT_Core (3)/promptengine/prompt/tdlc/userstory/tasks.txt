Given the following: 
{% if businesscontext != "" %}
We have outlined our Business Process Management (BPM) context, detailing Levels 1 to 4 between [businesscontext-start] and [businesscontext-end].
    L1-L4 Model Overview:
        L1: Industry Domain.
        L2: Industry Sub Domain.
        L3: Capability of Sub Domain
        L4: Sub Capabilities
    [businesscontext-start]
    {{ businesscontext }}
    [businesscontext-end]
Your role involves leveraging this BPM framework to perform the task at hand.
{% endif %}
{% if applicationcontext != "" %}
We have defined our Application Context between [applicationcontext-start] and [applicationcontext-end].
The Application Context is a high-level overview of the application landscape, modules and Tech stack.
[applicationcontext-start]
{{ applicationcontext }}
[applicationcontext-end]
{% endif %}
{% if highlevelreq != "" %}
We have defined our High Level Requirements between [highlevelreq-start] and [highlevelreq-end]. 
        [highlevelreq-start]
        {{ highlevelreq }}
        [highlevelreq-end]
{% endif %}
{% if processflow != "" %}
We have defined our Business Process Flow between [bpmprocessflow-start] and [bpmprocessflow-end].
This contains the process flow steps along with the key personas or actors who perform each step.
[bpmprocessflow-start]
{{ processflow }}
[bpmprocessflow-end]
{% endif %}
{% if epic != "" %}
We have defined our EPIC between [epic-start] and [epic-end].
[epic-start]
{{ epic }}
[epic-end]
{% endif %}
{% if feature != "" %}
We have defined our Selected Feature between [feature-start] and [feature-end].
[feature-start]
{{ feature }}
[feature-end]
{% endif %}

User will provide one of the User Stories of the Feature between [userstory-start] and [userstory-end]. This was one of the user stories of the Feature which was sliced using agile slicing Methodology
[userstory-start]
{{ userstory }}
[userstory-end]

Your task is to take the detailed User Story and breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks or sub-stories. Each task needs to be small enough to be completed within a sprint, but also provide a deliverable piece of work that adds value.

Please generate as many tasks as possible using INVEST Principle: The INVEST acronym stands for Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable. 
Ensure that each task should ideally be independent (can be worked on separately), negotiable (not overly prescriptive), valuable (provides value to the customer), estimable (has a clear enough scope to estimate effort), small (can be completed in a few days or less), and testable (has clear criteria for completion).

Let's practice with an example:
User Story: As a customer, I want to be able to search for products using natural language queries, so that I can find the products I need more easily. We believe this capability will result in improved customer satisfaction and increased sales.
Task 1: User Interface Design
    Sub Task 1: Design a search bar that is visible and accessible on the website's homepage.
    Sub Task 2: Design the layout for displaying search results, including product images, names, prices, and ratings.
    Sub Task 3: Design UI elements for filtering and sorting search results.
Task 2: Search Functionality
    Sub Task 1: Develop the functionality to accept natural language queries in the search bar.
    Sub Task 2: Implement an algorithm to process these queries and generate relevant search results.
    Sub Task 3: Implement the functionality to sort search results by relevance.
    Sub Task 4: Implement the functionality to link each product in the search results to its product detail page.
Task 3: Integration with Shopping Cart
    Sub Task 1: Implement the functionality to add a product to the shopping cart directly from the search results.
    Sub Task 2: Implement the functionality to link to the product detail page from the search results.
Task 4: Testing
    Sub Task 1: Write unit tests for the search functionality.
    Sub Task 1: Write integration tests to ensure the search feature works well with the rest of the website.
    Sub Task 1: Conduct usability testing to ensure the search feature is user-friendly and intuitive.

Please generate Tasks in the following format:
Task 1:
   Sub Task 1.1:
   Sub Task 1.2:
   Sub Task 1.3:

Task 2:
   Sub Task 2.1:
   Sub Task 2.2:
   Sub Task 2.3:

(And so on, for as many tasks as you expect to generate and try for a minimum of 10. Do it to best of your ability)
