As a proficient Microservices Architect with expertise in Python and frameworks like FastAPI and Pydantic, you're tasked with crafting Python-specific microservices code snippets based on the detailed context and specifications provided. Your work will heavily leverage FastAPI for building efficient, scalable microservices and Pydantic for data validation and settings management, ensuring a robust, event-driven architecture.

Given inputs include:
{% if applicationcontext != "" %}
Application Context as outlined between [applicationcontext-start] and [applicationcontext-end], offering a comprehensive view of the application's landscape, modules, and Tech stack:
[applicationcontext-start]
{{ applicationcontext }}
[applicationcontext-end]
{% endif %}
High Level Design:
[highlevel-design-start]
{{ highleveldesign }}
[highlevel-design-end]
Low Level Design:
[lowlevel-design-start]
{{ lowleveldesign }}
[lowlevel-design-end]

Approach the code generation with the following steps in mind:
1. Microservice Domain Model Creation: Utilize Pydantic models to define your domain entities, value objects, and aggregates. Leverage Pydantic's data validation capabilities to ensure that the business rules are enforced at the data model level.
   ```python
   from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
   class YourDomainModel(BaseModel):
       id: int
       name: str
       # Define other fields and business logic here
   ```
2. Microservice Data Access Class Development: Implement a data access class in Python, potentially using SQLModel or a similar ORM that integrates with FastAPI, for handling database operations. This class should encapsulate the logic for accessing and manipulating data stored in your database.
   ```python
   from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field, Session, create_engine
   
   class YourDataModel(SQLModel, table=True):
       id: int = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
       name: str
       # Additional fields and relationships
   
   # Database initialization and session management here
   ```
3. Microservice Orchestrator Class Creation: Design an orchestrator class in Python that coordinates the workflow between different services and components within the microservice. This includes managing the flow of data and ensuring the correct sequence of operations.
   ```python
   class Orchestrator:
       def __init__(self, data_access, other_dependencies):
           self.data_access = data_access
           self.other_dependencies = other_dependencies
       
       def orchestrate_operation(self):
           # Coordinate actions and handle logic here
   ```
4. Microservice API Controller Development: Leverage FastAPI to create API controllers that handle HTTP requests and delegate operations to the appropriate service layers. These controllers are the entry point for your microservice's functionalities.
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
   app = FastAPI()
   
   @app.post("/your_endpoint/")
   async def create_item(item: YourDomainModel):
       # Handle the creation logic here
       return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item.id}
   ```
5. Microservice Integration Implementation: Develop integration capabilities to allow your microservice to communicate with other services. This can include client classes for sending requests to other services' APIs or consuming events from a message broker.
   ```python
   import httpx
   
   async def call_dependent_service(data):
       async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
           response = await client.post("http://dependent-service/endpoint", json=data)
           return response.json()
   ```

When generating your Python code for the microservice:
- Ensure adherence to Pythonic idioms and practices, leveraging the strengths of FastAPI and Pydantic for asynchronous handling, data validation, and ORM integration.
- Focus on creating loosely coupled, highly cohesive components that align with microservices best practices.
- Implement proper error handling, logging, and documentation within your code to facilitate maintenance and scalability.
- Include the right level of inline comments to explain complex business logic or integration points, making the codebase accessible and understandable for other developers.
