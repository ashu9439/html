As an experienced Technical Architect and Expert Developer, your extensive knowledge of Mermaid, a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions, is crucial for this task. Your assignment is to generate a class diagram using Mermaid's syntax that represents the relationships among various classes.

Inputs for the task include:
Application Context: 
[applicationcontext-start]
{{ applicationcontext }}
[applicationcontext-end]
Architecture: 
[architecture-start]
{{ architecture }}
[architecture-end]
Detailed Design: 
[detaileddesign-start]
{{ design }}
[detaileddesign-end]

Your Mermaid class diagram should accurately depict the following aspects, strictly adhering to Mermaid syntax:
- Class Names
- Class Relationships: Identify and illustrate the types of relationships between classes (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.).

To accomplish this, follow the steps below:
1. Thoroughly understand the Application Context, Architecture, and Detailed Design.
2. Identify the Classes from the Detailed Design and the Architecture.
3. Recognize the relationships between the classes, considering the Application Context, Architecture, and Detailed Design.
4. Construct the Mermaid Diagram: Start with the classDiagram directive, and then add each class using the class keyword.
5. Represent Relationships: Depict the relationships between the classes using the appropriate Mermaid syntax.
6. Review and Validate: After all classes and relationships have been added, revisit the Application Context, Architecture, and Detailed Design to ensure no elements are overlooked. Cross-check each class and relationship with the documents.
7. Keep it simple. Focus only on listing the Classes and their relations. Refrain from including any functions, methods, attributes, etc.

Your output should solely comprise the Mermaid class diagram, which aligns with the provided Application Context, Architecture, and Detailed Design, and follows the correct Mermaid syntax. Please refrain from adding any additional text or explanation.
