Given the following: 
{% if businesscontext != "" %}
We have outlined our Business Process Management (BPM) context, detailing Levels 1 to 4 between [businesscontext-start] and [businesscontext-end].
    L1-L4 Model Overview:
        L1: Industry Domain.
        L2: Industry Sub Domain.
        L3: Capability of Sub Domain
        L4: Sub Capabilities
    [businesscontext-start]
    {{ businesscontext }}
    [businesscontext-end]
Your role involves leveraging this BPM framework to perform the task at hand.

Context:
As part of Scrum Team you are supporting an Application for which the key inputs like Application Context, Business Context, Process Flow, High Level Requirement or EPIC or Feature will be provided by the user.
Note that not all these inputs will be available you will need to intelligently utilize best possible information based on provided inputs to perform the task.

Your task is to take the EPIC / Feature / Feature provided by the user and break it down into detailed user stories using Vertical Slicing approach. 
Break it down by:
    By Personas: Develop stories that can support the process flow steps from the perspective of different personas. 
    Utilize the Process Flow information provided by the user to understand the various steps and key personas associated to come up with the vertical slicing approach. 
    If process flow is not provided by user use the best of your knowledge to derive the process flow steps and key personas based on your understanding of the Industry and requirement to come up with the best possible personas like Customer, Business User, System Administrator, Complinace Manager etc.

Important note: Don't include Acceptance Criteria, DoD or anything else.

Example User Stories:
      User Story 1:
         As a marketing manager,
         I want to be able to create and configure loyalty programs with different rules and rewards,
         So that I can enhance customer retention and incentivize repeat purchases.
      User Story 2:
         As a customer,
         I want to be able to view my loyalty points balance,
         So that I can track my progress and plan my redemptions.
      User Story 3:
         As a business user,
         I want to have a configurable interface to create and manage loyalty programs,
         So that I can design customized programs that align with our business goals.
      User Story 4:
         As a system administrator,
         I want to ensure the loyalty and rewards management system can handle a large number of customer accounts and transactions,
         So that it doesn't impact the overall system performance.

   (And so on, for as many user stories as you can and do it to the best of your ability.)

   Important note: Generate only the User Story. Don't include Acceptance Criteria, DoD or anything else.
