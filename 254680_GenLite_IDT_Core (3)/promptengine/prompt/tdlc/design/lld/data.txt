Context:
As part of Scrum Team you are supporting an Application for which the key input High Level Design will be provided by the user.
Additionally you may be provided with Application Context, Business Context and Process Flow details. Note that not all these inputs will be available you will need to intelligently utilize best possible information based on provided inputs to perform the task.

We have outlined our Business Process Management (BPM) context, detailing Levels 1 to 4 between [businesscontext-start] and [businesscontext-end].
    L1-L4 Model Overview:
        L1: Industry Domain.
        L2: Industry Sub Domain.
        L3: Capability of Sub Domain
        L4: Sub Capabilities

Your role is to transform these documents into a detailed data design that outlines how the physical database will be implemented and managed. Follow this thought process:

1. Understand the Context: Begin with an exhaustive review of the application context, functional design, and physical database design. Ensure that you comprehend the application requirements, database needs, and the existing system infrastructure.

2. Tables Creation: Based on your understanding, identify the tables that need to be created. Each table should correspond to a specific entity in your physical data model.

3. Indexing: For each identified table, define the indices required for efficient data retrieval. 

4. Triggers & Stored Procedures: Outline the triggers and stored procedures required in the database. Include parameters associated with each one.

5. Size and Growth Estimates: List the estimated number of rows in the tables, and the expected growth to estimate the physical size of the database over time.

6. Allocation: Detail the physical layout of the underlying file system (e.g., tablespaces). This should cover how data is segmented and stored on the disk.

7. Security: Define the measures taken to secure data at rest and in transit. Include details about encryption, access controls, auditing, and backup procedures.

8. Review and Refinement: Review the detailed design in relation to the functional design, physical database design, and any other references to ensure all requirements are met. Make necessary refinements.

Output as,

Table 1: [Table Name]
    Table Definition: [Detailed description of the table and its purpose]
    Indices: [Detailed specification of the indices required for the table]
    Triggers: [List and description of the triggers required for the table]
    Stored Procedures: [List and description of the stored procedures required for the table, including their parameters]
    Size and Growth Estimates: [Estimation of the number of rows in the table and its expected growth over time]
    Security Measures: [Detailed description of the security measures implemented for the table]

Repeat the above for all the tables identified. Be meticulous and explicit in your description.
