{# Instructions for Conversion #}
Output Required:
- Cypher Query: Convert python code to Cypher queries. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

Step-by-Step Approach:
1. Understand the Data Model:   Python: Uses variables, lists, dictionaries, classes, etc.
                                Cypher: Operates on nodes, relationships, and properties within a graph database (like Neo4j).

2. Identify the Data Entities: Determine what in your Python code corresponds to nodes and relationships in Cypher.
                                Example: In a social network, a User class in Python might correspond to User nodes in Cypher.

3. Map Functions to Queries:    Python Functions: These perform actions like calculations, data manipulations, etc.
                                Cypher Queries: These are used to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) nodes and relationships.

4. Translate Data Manipulations: Loops and Iterations: Often translate to Cypher's pattern matching and operations on result sets.
                                Conditionals: Use Cypher's WHERE clause to filter results.

5. Handle Specific Python Constructs: Lists and Dictionaries: Use Cypher collections and properties.
                                      Classes and Objects: Translate to nodes with properties and relationships.

6. Writing Node Creation Queries: Write Cypher queries to create nodes based on your python objects. Use the CREATE clause in Cypher to create nodes with specified properties.
    - Here's the basic syntax:
            Class Node: Represent each python class.
            Property Node: Represent each python property.
            Method Node: Represent each python method.
            Event Node: Represent each python event.
    - CREATE (node:Label {property1: value1, property2: value2, ...})    
    - node is the variable representing the node in the query and should not be duplicated.
    - Label is the label assigned to the node (optional) and should not be duplicated.
    - property1, property2, etc., are properties of the node and should not be duplicated for other call.
    - value1, value2, etc., are the corresponding values of the properties and should not be duplicated.
    - Ensure each create statement has atleast one property "name" and should not be duplicated.
	- Please ensure there are no duplicate create statements for the same node/property/field and with same name value.
    - Please do not create duplicate create statement if it is already created in the previous create statements with same name and value.

7. Mapping Relationships: If your python code includes relationships between objects (like associations between User and other entities), map these to relationships .
    **Define Relationship Types:**
    - `CONTAINS`: Between namespaces and classes, classes and methods/properties
    - `INHERITS_FROM`: Between classes
    - `CALLS`: Between methods
    - `HAS_PROPERTY`: Between classes and properties
	
8. Writing Relationship Creation Queries: Use Cypher's Create clauses to create relationships between nodes. Ensure you specify the relationship type and any properties associated with the relationship.
    - The basic syntax for creating relationships in Cypher is as follows:
      (node1)-[:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]->(node2)
    - node1 and node2 are the nodes you want to connect.
    - RELATIONSHIP_TYPE is the type of relationship between the nodes. 

Considerations:
 - Ensure the cypher code is clean, maintainable, and follows Cypher Query best practices.
 - Ensure the cypher code is not having any syntax error and follow coding standards of cypher.
 - DO NOT create duplicate 'CREATE' statements for same node/property/field/method/event and with same name value.
 - Ensure the uniqueId property is added to each node created in the cypher query
 - Please do not create duplicate create statement if it is already created in the previous create statements.

Proceed with these instructions to accurately convert the provided python code into cypher queries.
