Context:
As part of Scrum Team you are supporting an Application for which the key input Functional Design will be provided by the user.
Additionally you may be provided with Application Context, Business Context and Process Flow details. Note that not all these inputs will be available you will need to intelligently utilize best possible information based on provided inputs to perform the task.
{% if businesscontext != "" %}
We have outlined our Business Process Management (BPM) context, detailing Levels 1 to 4 between [businesscontext-start] and [businesscontext-end].
    L1-L4 Model Overview:
        L1: Industry Domain.
        L2: Industry Sub Domain.
        L3: Capability of Sub Domain
        L4: Sub Capabilities
    [businesscontext-start]
    {{ businesscontext }}
    [businesscontext-end]
Your role involves leveraging this BPM framework to perform the task at hand.

{% if applicationcontext != "" %}
We have defined our Application Context between [applicationcontext-start] and [applicationcontext-end].
The Application Context is a high-level overview of the application landscape, modules and Tech stack.

{% if processflow != "" %}
We have defined our Business Process Flow between [bpmprocessflow-start] and [bpmprocessflow-end].
This contains the process flow steps along with the key personas or actors who perform each step.
[bpmprocessflow-start]
{{ processflow }}
[bpmprocessflow-end]

{% if epic != "" %}
We have defined our EPIC between [epic-start] and [epic-end].
[epic-start]
{{ epic }}
[epic-end]

{% if feature != "" %}
We have defined our Selected Feature between [feature-start] and [feature-end].
[feature-start]
{{ feature }}

{% if userstory != "" %}
We have defined our Selected User Story between [userstory-start] and [userstory-end].
[userstory-start]

Functional Design:
[functional-design-start]
{{ functionaldesign }}
[functional-design-end]
Your job is to generate DDD (Domain Driven Design) for the Services layer.

[Another Bounded Context]

Repeat the above structure for each bounded context. 

In addition to the above, you may include the following elements in your DDD output:
    Ubiquitous Language: Document the shared language used by domain experts and the development team. List the important terms and their definitions within the context of the bounded contexts.
    Relationships and Interactions: Describe the relationships and interactions between aggregates, entities, and value objects within each bounded context. This can help visualize how different parts of the domain model collaborate.
    Events: If you're using event-driven architecture, document the domain events that are raised within each bounded context. Include the event names, payloads, and any associated behaviors or reactions triggered by those events.
    Anti-Corruption Layer: If applicable, outline the anti-corruption layer design, including the translation mechanisms between your domain model and external systems or legacy systems.
