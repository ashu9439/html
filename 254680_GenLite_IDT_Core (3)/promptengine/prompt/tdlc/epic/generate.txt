{% if industry != "" %}
Assume Domain knowledge in the Industry: {{ industry }}
{% endif %}

As part of Scrum Team you are supporting an Application for which the key inputs like Application Context, Business Context, Process Flow and High Level Requirement will be provided by the user.
Note that not all these inputs will be available and you will need to generate the EPIC with provided information.
{% if businesscontext != "" %}
We have outlined our Business Process Management (BPM) context, detailing Levels 1 to 4 between [businesscontext-start] and [businesscontext-end].
    L1-L4 Model Overview:
        L1: Industry Domain.
        L2: Industry Sub Domain.
        L3: Capability of Sub Domain
        L4: Sub Capabilities
    [businesscontext-start]
    {{ businesscontext }}
    [businesscontext-end]
Your role involves leveraging this BPM framework to perform the task at hand.
{% endif %}
{% if applicationcontext != "" %}
We have defined our Application Context between [applicationcontext-start] and [applicationcontext-end].
The Application Context is a high-level overview of the application landscape, modules and Tech stack.
[applicationcontext-start]
{{ applicationcontext }}
[applicationcontext-end]
{% endif %}
{% if highlevelreq != "" %}
We have defined our High Level Requirements between [highlevelreq-start] and [highlevelreq-end]. 
        [highlevelreq-start]
        {{ highlevelreq }}
        [highlevelreq-end]
{% endif %}
{% if processflow != "" %}
We have defined our Business Process Flow between [bpmprocessflow-start] and [bpmprocessflow-end].
This contains the process flow steps along with the key personas or actors who perform each step.
[bpmprocessflow-start]
{{ processflow }}
[bpmprocessflow-end]

Your task is to create an EPIC, which includes a EPIC level user story and corresponding acceptance criteria. 

Following should be your chain of thoughts:
Analyze the specific industry to understand its current trends, challenges, and future opportunities. This includes understanding the regulatory environment, competitive landscape, and customer needs specific to the industry.
Assess the application context in which the product will be used. This involves understanding the technological environment, user personas, and how the product fits into the users' workflows or life.
Evaluate the business context, including the strategic goals and objectives of the organization. This should align with the larger organizational vision and market strategy.
Based on the understanding of the industry, application, and business contexts, identify key problems that need to be solved or opportunities that can be exploited. This forms the basis for generating value-adding ideas.
Ensure that the Epic aligns with the high-level vision and strategy of the organization. It should contribute to the long-term goals and objectives of the company.
Identify for the EPIC Level user story, identify the persona that will be more relevant. 
Ensure that the story reflects the persona's needs, goals, and the context of their interaction with the product.

Generate the following:
EPIC Title: Provide a concise summary of the feature or functionality to be delivered.

EPIC Level User Story: Compose a user story considering user personas and their needs, following this format:
    - As a <user persona>,
    - I want to <do something>,
    - So that <I benefit>,
    - We Believe <this capability will result in this outcome>,
    - We will have confidence when we see <measurable signal>,
    - We will measure & track <signal>.

    Example 1: 
     - As an IT administrator
     - I want a feature that allows me to track and manage the carbon footprint of our cloud resources
     - so that we can meet our environmental sustainability goals. 
     - We will have confidence in this when we can effectively monitor and reduce our carbon footprint. 
     - We will measure & track this signal: reduction in carbon footprint over time.

Acceptance Criteria: Enumerate the specific conditions that must be met for the Epic to be considered complete, using this format:
    - Given <some condition>,
    - When <some action is carried out>,
    - Then <some expected outcome should occur>.

    Note: Remember to consider edge cases and exception paths while defining the acceptance criteria.

Risks and Dependencies: Identify any known or potential issues, blockers, or dependencies.

Design and Technical Specifications: Detail any known technical details or design requirements. Use your technical knowledge to anticipate any architectural needs or constraints.

Non-functional Requirements: List the requirements related to system performance, security, usability, etc., that are crucial for user satisfaction and system performance.
    Examples:
    - Performance: The integration should not impact the platform's performance or response times.
    - Security: The compliance monitoring tool should use secure communication protocols.
    - Usability: The tool should provide an intuitive interface for System Administrators.
