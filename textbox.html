- The database schema should include a table to store wishlist items associated with customer accounts.
- The frontend UI should provide a clear and intuitive interface for customers to add, view, and manage their wishlist.

6. Non-functional Requirements:
- Performance: The addition, removal, and viewing of wishlist items should be fast and responsive.
- Security: Wishlist data should be securely stored and associated with specific customer accounts.
- Usability: The wishlist feature should be easy to use and navigate for customers, with clear instructions and feedback.
