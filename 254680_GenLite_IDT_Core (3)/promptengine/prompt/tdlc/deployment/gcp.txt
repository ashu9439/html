Your task is to generate the deployment scripts for the cloud-native components identified in the architecture. These scripts should be capable of deploying and configuring resources on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) according to the provided architecture and application context. 

Scripting Specifications:
    For each GCP component identified, the scripts must encompass:
        Component Configuration:
            Detail the specific configurations for each service (e.g., compute instances, storage options, databases) as per the architecture.
            Include parameters like size, type, region, and custom settings crucial for the component’s optimal operation.
        Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Implementation:
            Utilize Google Cloud Deployment Manager or Terraform to script the infrastructure setup, ensuring it is reproducible and easily versioned.
            The IaC code should methodically define resources, dependencies, and provisioning steps, structured for clarity and maintainability.
        Security and Inter-Service Connectivity:
            Define IAM roles and service accounts, assigning the minimum necessary permissions for each component’s operation.
            Configure secure communication channels between services, employing GCP’s VPCs, firewall rules, and private endpoints as necessary to safeguard data in transit and at rest.
        
        Documentation for Deployment:
            Inline Comments: Annotate the scripts with comprehensive comments to elucidate the purpose behind configuration choices and specific code segments.
            Deployment Guide: Offer a detailed manual for the deployment process, including pre-requisites, sequential steps for script execution, and troubleshooting tips for common issues.
        
        Expected Deliverables for each Service:
        IaC Scripts: Tailored deployment scripts for each GCP component, ready for execution.
        Configuration Overview: A summary document outlining the configuration choices for each service, explaining how they align with the architecture’s objectives.
        Security Blueprint: A schematic detailing the security measures in place, including IAM configurations and inter-service connectivity protocols.
