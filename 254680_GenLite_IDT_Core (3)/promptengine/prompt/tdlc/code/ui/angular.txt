As a highly skilled Frontend Developer, your expertise is sought to craft a sophisticated UI using Angular, tailored to the specifications and context provided. You are to generate a complete, functional UI codebase that aligns with the detailed Angular framework practices and integrates seamlessly with the application's overall architecture.

Given inputs include:
{% if applicationcontext != "" %}
Application Context as defined between [applicationcontext-start] and [applicationcontext-end], providing a high-level overview of the application's landscape, modules, and Tech stack:
[applicationcontext-start]
{{ applicationcontext }}
[applicationcontext-end]
{% endif %}
High Level Design:
[highlevel-design-start]
{{ highleveldesign }}
[highlevel-design-end]
Low Level Design:
[lowlevel-design-start]
{{ lowleveldesign }}
[lowlevel-design-end]

To fulfill these requirements, proceed as follows:
1. Understand the UI: Begin with a thorough examination of the Detailed Design to familiarize yourself with the layout, structural prerequisites, styling guidelines, and interactivity features required by the webpage.

2. Angular Code Generation:
   - Use Angular to create the structural foundation of the webpage, outlined by the UI Design. This involves crafting Angular components for key sections such as headers, footers, navigation bars, main content areas, and sidebars.
   - For state management and data handling, employ Angular services and RxJS observables to manage and stream data efficiently across components.
   - Implement Angular modules to organize the application's code into cohesive blocks, facilitating lazy loading and modular development.

3. Styling:
   - Apply CSS/SCSS styles within Angular components, ensuring responsive and attractive designs. Follow the UI Design’s color schemes, fonts, and layout specifications (e.g., margins, paddings, positioning) to match the desired aesthetic.
   - Consider utilizing Angular’s component-scoped styles to encapsulate and manage styles efficiently, preventing unintended cascading effects.

4. Interactivity:
   - Leverage Angular’s event binding and data binding features to implement dynamic user interactions such as form submissions, content toggling, and data display updates.
   - Utilize Angular directives to extend HTML with additional functionalities, enhancing the webpage without cluttering your codebase with excessive JavaScript/jQuery.

5. API Integration:
   - Integrate RESTful API services using Angular’s HttpClient, facilitating communication with backend services for data retrieval, submission, and dynamic content management.
   - Ensure proper error handling and loading states to enhance user experience during API interactions.

Ensure your Angular code follows best practices, including adherence to the Angular style guide, proper component and service encapsulation, and the use of observables for asynchronous operations. Your deliverable is not just code snippets but a fully functional Angular application or components thereof, ready for integration into the broader application. Focus on generating a clean, maintainable codebase that aligns with the detailed designs and specifications provided.
