Step by Step Approach for creating FSD:
When provided with application context, business context, and other similar inputs, here's how you should effectively use them in creating a Functional Specification Document (FSD):

    Application Context:
    - Purpose and Scope: Understand the overall purpose and scope of the application. This includes the primary functions of the application and its intended users.
    - Technical Environment: Familiarize yourself with the technical environment in which the application operates, including existing software, hardware, and network infrastructure.
    - Integration Points: Identify how the application integrates with other systems or external services.
    - Limitations and Constraints: Note any technological or business limitations that might affect the design.

    Business Context:
    - Business Objectives: Understand the key business objectives that the application aims to achieve. This helps in aligning the functional design with business goals.
    - Stakeholder Analysis: Identify key stakeholders and their interests, concerns, and influence on the project. This ensures the design meets their needs and expectations.
    - Market and Industry Trends: Be aware of any market or industry trends that might influence the application's functionality or priorities.

    Process Flow Details:
    - Existing Processes: Examine any existing business processes that the application will support or replace. This helps in ensuring that the new design seamlessly integrates with current operations.
    - Process Improvements: Identify opportunities for process improvements or optimizations that the new application can facilitate.
    - Workflow Mapping: Map out the detailed workflows that the application will automate or support, including decision points, user roles involved, and expected outcomes.

    Utilizing Information:
    - Gap Analysis: Conduct a gap analysis between current capabilities and desired functionalities, using the provided context to identify what needs to be developed or enhanced.
    - Requirement Prioritization: Prioritize requirements based on their alignment with business goals, user needs, technical feasibility, and resource availability.
    - Design Considerations: Use the gathered information to make informed decisions about the user interface, data structures, security measures, and process workflows.

    User Story Analysis: If a user story is provided, thoroughly understand its context, the target user, their goals, and motivations. 
    - Acceptance Criteria: Analyze these to capture business logic needs and design implications.
    - DoR and DoD: Ensure requirements are well-defined (DoR) and have clear completion criteria (DoD).
    - Tasks/Sub-tasks: Identify necessary steps for implementing the feature, guiding functional design.
    High-Level Requirement Analysis: If a high-level requirement is provided, convert it into detailed requirements before proceeding with the functional design.

Your Task: Create a detailed Functional Specification Document focusing on User Interface Design. Use the provided template format between <fds-output-template-start> and <fds-output-template-end>, addressing each section with relevant details. 

Ensure the following,
   - Detailed Requirements: Translate the business and application contexts into detailed functional requirements.
   - Design Specifications: Develop clear and concise design specifications that align with the detailed requirements, ensuring they are feasible within the given contexts.
   - Traceability: Maintain traceability between requirements, design elements, and business objectives to ensure that all components of the FSD are aligned and justified.

Note: Your output should be an actual functional design. Do not generate anything else.

Output template is as follows,
<fds-output-template-start>
User Interface Design - For each page, provide the following details.
    Page Name 1: Specify the name of the page or its identifier.
    Purpose: Describe the purpose of the page in the overall application.
    Layout: Describe the arrangement of elements on the page in CSV format.
        - Element Name: Specify each element's name or identifier.
        - Element Type: Specify the type (button, text box, dropdown, etc.).
        - Element Functionality: Describe what each element does when interacted with. For each active element, specify the possible user actions, the corresponding response, and the effect of that response.
    Example Layout:
        Element Name,Element Type,Element Functionality
        "Analyte Name",Text Field,"Accepts the name of the Analyte. Validates the input against a predefined list of Analytes."
        "Batch ID",Text Field,"Accepts the ID of the batch in which the Analyte sample was processed."
        "Sample ID",Text Field,"Accepts the ID of the Analyte sample."
        "Equipment ID",Text Field,"Accepts the ID of the equipment used for measuring the Analyte."
        "Operator ID",Text Field,"Accepts the ID of the operator who conducted the measurement."
        "Test ID",Text Field,"Accepts the ID of the test conducted on the Analyte."
        "Measurement Value",Numeric Field,"Accepts the measured value of the Analyte. Validates the input to ensure it is a numeric value."
        "Measurement Unit",Dropdown,"Allows the user to select the unit of measurement from a predefined list of units."
        "Control Value",Numeric Field,"Accepts the control value used for the test. Validates the input to ensure it is a numeric value."
        "Quality Assurance Checks",Checkbox,"Allows the user to indicate whether specific quality assurance checks were completed."
        "Date & Time of Measurement",Date/Time Field,"Accepts the date and time the Analyte was measured. Validates the input to ensure it is a valid date/time format."
        "Submit Button",Button,"When clicked, triggers the validation and data storage process."
        "Error/Warning Messages",Text,"Displays error messages for invalid data and warning messages for duplicate data."

    - Responsive Design: Detail how each page's layout adapts to different screen sizes.
    - Accessibility: Define how the design supports accessibility. Specify the techniques or strategies used to make the content accessible to people with disabilities. This could include things like providing alt text for images, ensuring sufficient color contrast, making the interface navigable via keyboard alone, offering resizable text, or including captions for audio content.
    - Model/View/Controller Information: Specify the design and interaction of the UI classes, controllers, and views.
        - Model Design/UI Classes: Describe the design and behavior of the UI classes.
        - Controllers: Define the role and behavior of the controllers in managing user interaction, manipulating data, and updating the view.
        - View: Explain how the view displays information to the user.
    - Page and Widget: Detail the design and behavior of the page and the widgets in the UI.
    - Sequence Diagram: Provide a sequence diagram detailing the interaction of objects in the application.
    - Session Management: Describe how the application manages the user's session.
        - Global Session: Detail how the application handles the global session state.
        - Navigation Session: Explain how the application manages the session during navigation.
    - Environment Variables: Specify the environment variables used in the application and their roles.
