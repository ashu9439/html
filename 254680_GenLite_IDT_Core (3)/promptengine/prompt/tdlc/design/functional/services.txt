Step by Step Approach for creating FSD:
When provided with application context, business context, and other similar inputs, here's how you should effectively use them in creating a Functional Specification Document (FSD):

    Application Context:
    - Purpose and Scope: Understand the overall purpose and scope of the application. This includes the primary functions of the application and its intended users.
    - Technical Environment: Familiarize yourself with the technical environment in which the application operates, including existing software, hardware, and network infrastructure.
    - Integration Points: Identify how the application integrates with other systems or external services.
    - Limitations and Constraints: Note any technological or business limitations that might affect the design.

    Business Context:
    - Business Objectives: Understand the key business objectives that the application aims to achieve. This helps in aligning the functional design with business goals.
    - Stakeholder Analysis: Identify key stakeholders and their interests, concerns, and influence on the project. This ensures the design meets their needs and expectations.
    - Market and Industry Trends: Be aware of any market or industry trends that might influence the application's functionality or priorities.

    Process Flow Details:
    - Existing Processes: Examine any existing business processes that the application will support or replace. This helps in ensuring that the new design seamlessly integrates with current operations.
    - Process Improvements: Identify opportunities for process improvements or optimizations that the new application can facilitate.
    - Workflow Mapping: Map out the detailed workflows that the application will automate or support, including decision points, user roles involved, and expected outcomes.

    Utilizing Information:
    - Gap Analysis: Conduct a gap analysis between current capabilities and desired functionalities, using the provided context to identify what needs to be developed or enhanced.
    - Requirement Prioritization: Prioritize requirements based on their alignment with business goals, user needs, technical feasibility, and resource availability.
    - Design Considerations: Use the gathered information to make informed decisions about the user interface, data structures, security measures, and process workflows.

    User Story Analysis: If a user story is provided, thoroughly understand its context, the target user, their goals, and motivations. 
    - Acceptance Criteria: Analyze these to capture business logic needs and design implications.
    - DoR and DoD: Ensure requirements are well-defined (DoR) and have clear completion criteria (DoD).
    - Tasks/Sub-tasks: Identify necessary steps for implementing the feature, guiding functional design.
    High-Level Requirement Analysis: If a high-level requirement is provided, convert it into detailed requirements before proceeding with the functional design.

Your Task: Create a detailed Functional Specification Document focusing on Process and Workflow Design. Use the provided template format between <fds-output-template-start> and <fds-output-template-end>, addressing each section with relevant details. 

Ensure the following,
   - Detailed Requirements: Translate the business and application contexts into detailed functional requirements.
   - Design Specifications: Develop clear and concise design specifications that align with the detailed requirements, ensuring they are feasible within the given contexts.
   - Traceability: Maintain traceability between requirements, design elements, and business objectives to ensure that all components of the FSD are aligned and justified.

Note: Your output should be an actual functional design. Do not generate anything else.

<fds-output-template-start>
1. Process Design:
   - Considerations: Focus on how the application will support business processes. Understand the sequence of actions, decision-making criteria, and roles involved in each process.
   - System Interface: 
     - Describe how the application interacts with other systems.
     - Consider data exchange formats, protocols, and security aspects.
   - Data Flow Steps:
     - Detail the movement of data through the system.
     - Consider data sources, destinations, transformations, and error handling.
   - Message Specification:
     - Specify formats and content of messages exchanged with external systems.
     - Include considerations for data integrity, security, and compliance.
   - Sequence:
     - Outline the chronological order of interactions or data flows.
     - Consider dependencies between different steps and external triggers.
   - Message Details:
     - Detail specifics like message type, frequency, and volume.
     - Include error handling, retry mechanisms, and synchronization needs.

2. Use Case Realization:
   - Considerations: Identify how each use case will be realized in terms of system components and interactions.
   - Simulate use cases to understand the necessary components, interfaces, and data flow.
   - Consider user experience, performance requirements, and scalability.

   Example Output:
     - Use Case: "Order Processing"
     - Components Identified: User Interface (UI) for order entry, Order Management System (OMS), Payment Gateway, and Notification Service.
     - Interactions: The UI communicates with the OMS to record orders. The OMS interacts with the Payment Gateway for payment processing and triggers the Notification Service upon successful transaction.
     - Data Flow: User inputs order details → OMS validates and processes order → Payment Gateway handles payment → Notification Service sends confirmation.
     - Performance Considerations: OMS should process orders within 2 seconds under normal load.

3. Domain Class Model:
   - Considerations: Focus on how business concepts are represented within the system.
   - Use conceptual data models to create a domain model that represents key entities and their relationships.
   - Consider normalization, data integrity, and how changes in one part of the model affect others.

   Example Output:
     - Entities: Order, Customer, Product, Payment.
     - Relationships: Each Order is linked to one Customer and can include multiple Products. Each Order is associated with one Payment record.
     - Attributes: 
       - Order: Order ID, Date, Status.
       - Customer: Customer ID, Name, Contact Details.
       - Product: Product ID, Name, Price.
       - Payment: Payment ID, Order ID, Amount, Method.
     - Data Integrity Rules: All Orders must have a valid Customer and at least one Product. Payments must be linked to a valid Order.

4. Workflows:
   - Considerations: Describe step-by-step how the system will execute its functions.
   - Include user interactions, system responses, and integration points.
   - Consider exception handling, user experience, and efficiency of the workflow.

    Example Output:
     - Workflow for "Leave Application" Process:
       - Step 1: Employee submits leave request via UI.
       - Step 2: System checks leave balance and validates request.
       - Step 3: Request is sent to the manager for approval.
       - Decision Point: If approved, go to Step 4. If rejected, notify employee and end process.
       - Step 4: Update leave balance and send confirmation to the employee.
       - User Interactions: Leave request submission, manager's approval/rejection.
       - Integration: HR Management System for leave balance and record updates.

5. Algorithms:
   - Considerations: Outline any complex calculations or data processing the system must perform.
   - Include algorithms' efficiency, accuracy, and impact on system performance.
   - Consider edge cases and how the algorithm behaves under different conditions.

   Example Output:
     - Algorithm for "Price Calculation":
       - Inputs: List of product IDs, quantities, customer type.
       - Process: Retrieve product prices. Apply quantity discounts. Add tax based on customer location. Apply additional discounts for specific customer types.
       - Edge Cases: Handle products with no price set as special cases. Apply maximum discount limits.
       - Performance: The algorithm should complete execution within 500 milliseconds for up to 100 items.

6. Component Interaction:
   - Considerations: Describe how different parts of the system communicate with each other.
   - Include internal function calls, RESTful APIs for microservices, or message queues for asynchronous processes.
   - Consider data consistency, transaction management, and error handling.

   - Example Output:
     - Interactions in "Inventory Management System":
       - Components: Web Interface, Inventory Database, Reporting Module, External Supplier System.
       - Communication: Web Interface sends requests to Inventory Database to update or retrieve stock levels. Reporting Module fetches data from Inventory Database for analytics. Automatic restock requests are sent to the External Supplier System when stock falls below a threshold.
       - Data Consistency: Use database transactions to ensure stock levels are accurately updated.
       - Error Handling: If communication with the External Supplier System fails, an alert is sent to the system administrator.
