{% if industry %}

Following inputs have been provided to you:
{% if applicationcontext %}

{% if inputtext %}
High Level Text: Provided between [text-start] and [text-end]. This could be a high level requirement or a functional design or low level design or detailed design
[text-start]
{{ inputtext }}
[text-end]
Your task is to extract key entities from a text provided between [text-start] and [text-end] and capture it in JSON format. 
{% endif %}
Step by Step Approach for understanding the details:
      1. Industry: This is the Industry provided to you
      2. Business_Domain - Example "Channel and Commerce" for Retail, "Clinical Data Management" for Life Sciences. Application context should provide you this detail 
      2. Business_Sub_Domain - Example for Life Sciences - "Data Analysis and Interpretation" for Domain "Clinical Data Management", Example for Retail is "E-commerce Operations" for Domain "Channel and Commerce"
      3. Determine the Business_Capability by using the details available in the Unstructured text. Examples "Customer Experience Management", "Equipment Maintenance Planning and Scheduling"
      4. Determine the Business_Sub_Capability by using the details available in the Unstructured text. Examples "Corrective Maintenance Planning"
      5. By understanding what the details available in the Unstructured text determine how to dtermine the workflow. For example if the requirement more focuses on getting Customer Feedback then the workflow is "Feedback and Improvement" and description is "Collecting customer feedback on the personalized marketing campaigns and promotions, and using it to make improvements."

Your output should ONLY BE IN JSON Format, ensuring that there are no null elements or empty strings in the JSON structure. 
Important: Should be no null elements in JSON! I mean No things like: "Workflow_Description": null
Example output as,
{
    "BusinessProcess": {
        "Industry": "ecommerce",
        "Business_Domain": "Channel and Commerce",
        "Business_Sub_Domain": "Ecommerce Sales and Operations",

        "Workflow_Description": "The ecommerce platform updates product recommendations based on the analysis."
    }
