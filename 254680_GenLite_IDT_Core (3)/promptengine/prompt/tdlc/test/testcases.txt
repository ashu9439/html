Utilize your expertise in testing methodologies to construct test cases with clear steps and expected results, based on the following inputs:
{% if businesscontext != "" %}
We have outlined our Business Process Management (BPM) context, detailing Levels 1 to 4 between [businesscontext-start] and [businesscontext-end].
    L1-L4 Model Overview:
        L1: Industry Domain.
        L2: Industry Sub Domain.
        L3: Capability of Sub Domain
        L4: Sub Capabilities
    [businesscontext-start]
    {{ businesscontext }}
    [businesscontext-end]
Your role involves leveraging this BPM framework to perform the task at hand.
{% endif %}
{% if applicationcontext != "" %}
We have defined our Application Context between [applicationcontext-start] and [applicationcontext-end].
The Application Context is a high-level overview of the application landscape, modules and Tech stack.
[applicationcontext-start]
{{ applicationcontext }}
[applicationcontext-end]
{% endif %}
{% if highlevelreq != "" %}
We have defined our High Level Requirements between [highlevelreq-start] and [highlevelreq-end]. 
        [highlevelreq-start]
        {{ highlevelreq }}
        [highlevelreq-end]
{% endif %}
{% if processflow != "" %}
We have defined our Business Process Flow between [bpmprocessflow-start] and [bpmprocessflow-end].
This contains the process flow steps along with the key personas or actors who perform each step.
[bpmprocessflow-start]
{{ processflow }}
[bpmprocessflow-end]

{% if epic != "" %}
We have defined our EPIC between [epic-start] and [epic-end].
[epic-start]
{{ epic }}
[epic-end]

{% if feature != "" %}
We have defined our Selected Feature between [feature-start] and [feature-end].
[feature-start]
{{ feature }}
[feature-end]

Approach for Creating Test Cases:
- Examine the BPM, User Story, and provided Test Scenarios to gain a comprehensive understanding of the system's functionality and requirements.
- Formulate detailed test cases that effectively validate each aspect of the Test Scenarios, as illustrated in the BPM and User Story.
- Ensure that your test cases are robust, covering various aspects including functional, integration, and system testing as applicable.
- Clarity and Detail: Ensure each step is clearly described and easy to follow. Avoid ambiguity.
- Scope and Focus: Each test case should focus on a specific aspect of functionality. Avoid trying to test multiple things in one test case.
- Independence: Ideally, test cases should be independent and not rely on the outcome of another test case.
- Data-Driven Testing: If applicable, structure test cases to allow for data-driven testing where you can test multiple data sets with the same steps.
- Negative Testing: Include test cases for negative scenarios to ensure the system handles errors or unexpected inputs gracefully.
- Ensure atleast one test case is created for each and every Test Scenario

Expected Output:
    Test Case ID: A unique identifier for each test case. This helps in tracking and managing test cases.
    Test Case Description: A brief summary of what the test case will verify. This should be clear and concise.
    Associated Test Scenario: Reference to the test scenario this case is part of. This links the test case to the broader testing context.
    Prerequisites/Preconditions: Conditions that must be met before the test can be executed, like specific system states or data setup requirements.
    Test Steps: Detailed steps to be followed during the test. Each step should be clear and precise, specifying exactly what needs to be done.
    Test Data: Any specific data required for testing. This could include input values, setup information, or environment configurations.
    Expected Result: The expected outcome of the test after executing the steps. This is crucial for determining if the test has passed or failed.
